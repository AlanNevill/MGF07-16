Meadow Green Farm nestles in a rural valley on the outskirts of the popular and bustling seaside village of Saundersfoot. 
There are 23 acres of farmland; two beautifully enclosed lakes stocked with fish; a woodland walk alongside a bubbling brook and all beautifully maintained and set with strategically placed seating areas; so one can relax, soak up the peace and watch the bird and wildlife. 
The owners offer a menu of home cooked meals or picnics for you to order.

While Meadow Green Farm offers a haven, you are only a short 15 minute walk for the energetic from Saundersfoot. From the top of the drive you can admire views down the valley and out to sea. There are beautiful long sandy beaches to explore in Saundersfoot, as well as a wealth of shops, pubs and restaurants. The pretty harbour town of Tenby is close by, as well as a number of family attractions such as Oakwood Park, Folly Farm, Manor House and Heatherton Park.
