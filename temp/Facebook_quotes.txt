Had a great few days in October in Cornflower Cottage. We were made to feel so welcome and the cottage was so cosy and comfortable. Didn't manage to sample Rob's cooking which is obviously very popular from the comments in the visitors book but will hopefully get the opportunity next time!

We had a wonderful week staying at Cornflower Cottage, what a lovely place! A big thank you to Gwen, Alan, Rob & Grandad for making us feel so welcome - we hope to see you again next year.
