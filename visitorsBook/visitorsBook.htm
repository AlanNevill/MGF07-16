	<h2>Liz, Paul &amp; Sara - September 2013 Cornflower</h2>
<p>
Another lovely holiday on our second stay in cornflower cottage. We had a 
fantastic time exploring the area again. Robs food was delicious and highly

and of course playing with Maisie! Hope to return soon it certainly is a home 
from home.
</p>

						August 2013 Cowslip</h2>
<p>
We have had a lovely weeks holiday, starting off with a really friendly welcome

delicious. We loved collecting eggs and now want chickens too! We also loved 
playing with Maisie. What a lovely place to have a holiday. Harvey has also had 
a fantastic first holiday - thank you so much - I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back.</p>

We have had a lovely week staying in Cornflower cottage, it&#39;s been decorated 
tastefully to a great standard and has everything you need. Gwen is wonderfully 
welcome and really looks after you (Thank you for doing some washing for me) 
Rob&#39;s cooking is a wonderful treat. It is also a great location, close to lots 
of beaches &amp; amenities. This would definitely be a place we come back to :)</p>

<p>This is our third visir to Meadow Green Farm and yet again we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Thank you for making us feel most welcome.</p>
	
						<h2>Miles &amp; Ford Families - June 2013 Meadowsweet</h2>
<p>
Don&#39;t want to go home! Had such an amazing week staying in Meadowseet, you could 
not ask for better accommodation &amp; facilities for everyone - especially the 
beach hut for our granddaughter, so much to do &amp; so well equipped. A big thank 
you to our personal chef Rob, your culinary skills were second to none. We will 
be back - Simply amazing!</p>
	<h2>Jane &amp; family - May 2013 Cornflower</h2>
	<p>We were recommended to come to the cottage by our cousin who came last 
	year, and indeed came back at the same time as us. The cottage and peaceful 
	location are lovely and the hospitality is wonderful. We were told not to 
	bring much for the children as everything would be here for them and that 
	was true! the children hardly played with any of their own toys! They loved 
	playing with Maisie aswell. Great holiday and would love to come back again.</p>
	
	<h2>Storer Family - May 2013 Meadowsweet</h2>
	<p>Hi, well what can I say; from the minute we got here we all loved it, even Benji our dog. The cottage is beautiful; everything you could possibly need. 
	Thank you Rob for cooking us some lovely food. Brian's 60th, we all made is special for him. We will be back later on this year. Love Storer family xxx</p>
	
	<h2>Clare &amp; family - November 2012 Cornflower</h2>
<p>
Had a great few days in October in Cornflower Cottage. 
We were made to feel so welcome and the cottage was so cosy and comfortable. 
Didn't manage to sample Rob's cooking which is obviously very popular from the comments in the visitors book but will hopefully get the opportunity next time!
</p>
						<h2>Maddy Fuller - September 2012 Cornflower</h2>

						<p>
Our third time here and everything brilliant as usual, the lovely warm welcome 
and all the little touched that mean so much. Rosie of course had a wonderful 
time through the meadows.</p>

Cornflower Cottage 2012</h2>
						<p>
We had a lovely week in Cornflower Cottage and echo all the previous comments- 
Cornflower Cottage is a lovely, cosy home from home cottage and we felt happy 
and settled in as soon as we arrived! The effort that Gwen, Alan and Rob put 
into ensure that guests enjoy their stay has really made a difference to our 
holiday. From the welcoming touches in the cottage - yummy welsh cakes, squash, 
tea, milk on arrival, fluffy towels and comfy beds,, to a wonderful toy barn 
which the boys loved and the amazing meals cooked by Rob. Not to forget, 
the sheep, chickens and our boys new best friend Maisy</p>
						
						<h2>
Ivan - 2012 Cowslip</h2>
						<p>
An absolutely fabulous location with everything&nbsp; wonderfully presented 
throughout the cottage. The food provided by Rob was particulary sublime. Thank 
you it has been a fantastic stay.</p>
						<h2>
Nicola &amp; family - 2012 Meadowsweet</h2>
						<p>
We were told a relaxing holiday with two small children wasn&#39;t possible - not 
true. A day filled with sea air, visiting the many many attractions nearby 
topped off with playing in the beach hut...what more could a little person want?</p>
						<p>
Mum and dad were delighted with Robs amazing cooking, peace quiet and the most 
comfortable bed you can imagine.</p>
						<p>
All in all a fantastic holiday. The cottages and grounds are a delight...every 
possibility has been considered and catered for</p>
						<h2>
Cornflower 2012</h2>
						<p>
We have had a wonderful week here in Cornflower. The cottage is lovely and has 
so many thoughtful touches The welcome from gwen, Alan , Rob and Maisy has been 
nothing short of perfect. Our son has loved playing with Maisy, helping plant 
seeds, feeding the lambs.</p>
						<p>
The beach hut is a fantastic idea for adults and children alike. Rob&#39;s cooking 
is excellent.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
						<h2>
Ben &amp; family, Perth - December 2011 Meadowsweet</h2>
						<p>
A perfect place for a family reunion. All three cottages truly felt like a home 
from home as soon as we walked through the door.</p>
						<p>
Real Christmas trees and all the cottages decorated superbly and made for a 
wonderful festive atmosphere. Rob&#39;s delicious hearty meals kept everything 
feeling cosy. Wonderful walks along Pembrokeshire many beautiful beaches. 
Wrapped up warm and walking through the fields with children, dogs, sheep and 
cats following. Wonderful.</p>
						<p>
Back home to our cottages with the many board games, puzzles and books 
kept everyone entertained. The twinkly lights around all the cottages made 
Meadow Green farm very magical. Thank you. See you in 2013</p>
