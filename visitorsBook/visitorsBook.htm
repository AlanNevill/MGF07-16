	<h2>Storer Family - May 2013 Meadowsweet</h2>
	<p>Hi, well what can I say; from the minute we got here we all loved it, even Benji our dog. The cottage is beautiful; everything you could possibly need. 
	Thank you Rob for cooking us some lovely food. Brian's 60th, we all made is special for him. We will be back later on this year. Love Storer family xxx</p>
	
<h2>Wakeham Family - June 2013 Meadowsweet</h2>	
<p>This is our third visir to Meadow Green Farm and yet again we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Thank you for making us feel most welcome.</p>
	
						<h2>Rachael &amp  Ricky, Chepstow - November 2012 Cowslip</h2>
<p>
We really enjoyed our stay here, it is beautiful and the cottages are perfect. 
Thank you so much to Gwen for making such a fuss of the children! They love it 
here and don&#39;t want to leave!. The children&#39;s&#39; facilities were much appreciated 
and they enjoyed being with the sheep, Maisy and collecting eggs. Thank you to 
Alan for taxing us to Saundersfoot and to Rob for the lovely Sunday lunch. We 
have had a weekend to remember and we will be back very soon!</p>

						<h2>Clare Titchener - November 2012 Cornflower</h2>
<p>
Had a great few days in October in Cornflower Cottage. 
We were made to feel so welcome and the cottage was so cosy and comfortable. 
Didn't manage to sample Rob's cooking which is obviously very popular from the comments in the visitors book but will hopefully get the opportunity next time!
</p>
						<h2>Maddy Fuller - September 2012 Cornflower</h2>
<p>
We had a wonderful week staying at Cornflower Cottage, what a lovely place! A big thank you to Gwen, Alan, Rob &amp 
Granddad for making us feel so welcome - we hope to see you again next year. 
The Madge Family x PS. The boys miss Maisie!</p>
						<h2>
Heather and Phil, Redditch - 2012 Cowslip</h2>
						<p>
Our third time here and everything brilliant as usual, the lovely warm welcome 
and all the little touched that mean so much. Rosie of course had a wonderful 
time through the meadows.</p>
						<h2>
Cornflower Cottage 2012</h2>
						<p>
We had a lovely week in Cornflower Cottage and echo all the previous comments- 
Cornflower Cottage is a lovely, cosy home from home cottage and we felt happy 
and settled in as soon as we arrived! The effort that Gwen, Alan and Rob put 
into ensure that guests enjoy their stay has really made a difference to our 
holiday. From the welcoming touches in the cottage - yummy welsh cakes, squash, 
tea, milk on arrival, fluffy towels and comfy beds,, to a wonderful toy barn 
which the boys loved and the amazing meals cooked by Rob. Not to forget, 
the sheep, chickens and our boys new best friend Maisy</p>
						
						<h2>
Ivan Halesowen - 2012 Cowslip</h2>
						<p>
An absolutely fabulous location with everything&nbsp; wonderfully presented 
throughout the cottage. The food provided by Rob was particulary sublime. Thank 
you it has been a fantastic stay.</p>
						<h2>
Nicola and family, London - 2012 Meadowsweet</h2>
						<p>
We were told a relaxing holiday with two small children wasn&#39;t possible - not 
true. A day filled with sea air, visiting the many many attractions nearby 
topped off with playing in the beach hut...what more could a little person want?</p>
						<p>
Mum and dad were delighted with Robs amazing cooking, peace quiet and the most 
comfortable bed you can imagine.</p>
						<p>
All in all a fantastic holiday. The cottages and grounds are a delight...every 
possibility has been considered and catered for</p>
						<h2>
Cornflower 2012</h2>
						<p>
We have had a wonderful week here in Cornflower. The cottage is lovely and has 
so many thoughtful touches The welcome from gwen, Alan , Rob and Maisy has been 
nothing short of perfect. Our son has loved playing with Maisy, helping plant 
seeds, feeding the lambs.</p>
						<p>
The beach hut is a fantastic idea for adults and children alike. Rob&#39;s cooking 
is excellent.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
						<h2>
Ben and family, Perth - December 2011 Meadowsweet</h2>
						<p>
A perfect place for a family reunion. All three cottages truly felt like a home 
from home as soon as we walked through the door.</p>
						<p>
Real Christmas trees and all the cottages decorated superbly and made for a 
wonderful festive atmosphere. Rob&#39;s delicious hearty meals kept everything 
feeling cosy. Wonderful walks along Pembrokeshire many beautiful beaches. 
Wrapped up warm and walking through the fields with children, dogs, sheep and 
cats following. Wonderful.</p>
						<p>
Back home to our cottages with the many board games, puzzles and books 
kept everyone entertained. The twinkly lights around all the cottages made 
Meadow Green farm very magical. Thank you. See you in 2013</p>
